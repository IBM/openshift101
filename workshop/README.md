# OpenShift 101

## Learn the Basics of Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud

A recent [study](https://github.com/svennam92/openshift101/tree/ab7f1406831de9aa1a60da349dd5bff8d11f7e13/workshop/study/README.md) by McKinsey & Company reveals that only 20 percent of enterprise applications have moved to the cloud. We believe that a hybrid cloud approach, built on open source and a vibrant open ecosystem, is the best way to move the remaining 80 percent.

Red Hat OpenShift represents a common platform, based on the industry-standard Kubernetes, that allows you to build on premises, on the IBM Cloud, or on any other leading cloud platform. You want freedom of choice; Red Hat OpenShift offers exactly that.

In this lab we'll cover using the OpenShift platform on the IBM Cloud and the common developer loop around cloud native applications including:

* Kubernetes Basics
* OpenShift Basics
* Deploying an application
    * Source-to-Image \(s2i\)
* Reading logs and monitoring the application
    * Console Logs
    * Terminal/SSH
    * Grafana
* Scaling the application
    * Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
    * Resource Limits
* Health Checks
    * Readiness and Liveness Probes
