## OpenShift 101: Learn the Basics of Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud

A recent [study](https://github.com/svennam92/openshift101/tree/ab7f1406831de9aa1a60da349dd5bff8d11f7e13/workshop/study/README.md) by McKinsey & Company reveals that only 20 percent of enterprise applications have moved to the cloud. We believe that a hybrid cloud approach, built on open source and a vibrant open ecosystem, is the best way to move the remaining 80 percent.

## So what is OpenShift

To quote Wikipedia:

> OpenShift is a family of containerization software developed by Red Hat. Its flagship product is the OpenShift Container Platform-an on-premises platform as a service built around Docker containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
> The Openshift UI has various functionalities, allowing one to monitor the container resources, container health, the nodes the containers reside on, IP addresses of the nodes, etc. The key store can be accessed via the Secrets in Openshift. The OC CLI command line tool also offers similar functionalities.

But the short of it? It's a abstraction layer **ON TOP** of Kubernetes. It's a way to empower Developers to deploy code and not worry about a lot of the underlying ecosystem. This workshop should show you the happy path to take advantage of most of the best parts of OpenShift and what it can offer.

The goals of this workshop are:

* To familiarize the reader with OpenShift
* Deploy a Node.js application to OpenShift
* Use OpenShift's features to monitor, scale the application
