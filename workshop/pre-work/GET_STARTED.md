# Creating your IBM account and Accessing your OpenShift cluster

In this section, you will login to your own IBM Cloud account, and then get access to a IBM Cloud Lab account which contains pre-provisioned clusters. Each lab attendee will be granted access to one cluster.

## Setting up your IBM Cloud ID

* Log into IBM Cloud with an existing account: <https://cloud.ibm.com>

OR

* Create your own: <http://cloud.ibm.com/registration>

## Accessing the Cluster

Instructors will provide a URL to a web app. Enter your IBMid (the email you used to sign up) and the lab key (also provided by the instructor).
